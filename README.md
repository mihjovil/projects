# My projects
This is the summary of the contents of my public repositories with the links to find them in my profile.
## 1. [Credit Risk Project](https://github.com/mihjovil/creditAnalysis)
This project is mainly a data exploratory analysis done on a dataset with bank information from the old days in Germany. In it I display different techniques and analysis done on the data which would make part of any Data Science project. At the end, I use different models to predict when a user is risky or not to give a credit.
## 2. [Currency Forecast](https://github.com/mihjovil/currencyForecast)
This project consists of a currency rate exchange forecaster. Useful for me as a Colombian traveling to the US. The ides of this project was to create a Deep Learning model that would give me the most accurate prediction of the TRM up to one week in advance. Obviously the further ahead in time the most innacurate it becomes. However, it gives very acceptable results taking the scale in which the US dollar affect the Colombian Peso.
## 3. [Chatbot](https://github.com/mihjovil/chatbot)
This project consist of a python application that creates a chatbot to interact with through the console. Using the JSON file you can add any type of category to interact with the chatbot and also specify what answer you wish the chatbot to return. The DL model used for this chatbot can be easily improved given that so far I have not done any hyper-parameter optimization.
## 4. [DL workshop](https://github.com/mihjovil/dl_workshop)
This project consists of a jupyter file that contains an introduction to DL projects in jupyter. I created this in order to explain to some colleagues the basics of Python, Tensorflow and Jupyter. Also I cover topics like numpy and pandas. In the end I give a basic introduction to the most commons applications of Neural Networks.
## 5. [Fifa Analysis](https://github.com/mihjovil/fifaAnalysis)
I have only started with this project but the idea is to do a deep data exploratory analysis on a Fifa dataset of all players. Try to do some clustering and maybe even some further activity to predict the most important atributes to determine the price of a player.
